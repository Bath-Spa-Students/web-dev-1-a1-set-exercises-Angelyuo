    <h3>For the manakish dough</h3>
    <ul> <!--Unordered list 2 // An unorder list for the ingredients-->
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 cup of lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of dried active yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoon mild olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="border">Method</h2> <!--An h2 tag for the method-->
    <h3>To prepare the cheese</h3>
    <ol> <!--Ordered list-->
        <li>If you are using akkawi baladi cheese, grate it in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>If you are using Akkawi chikkie cheese, then grate the cheese and soak it in a bowl of water for half an hour before. 
            Drain in a sieve then squeeze out the extra moisture with your hands and set aside</li>
    </ol> 
    <h3>To make the Dough</h3>
    <ol> <!--Ordered list 2 // An order list for the steps involved in the recipe 'method'-->
        <li>Add the sugar to the luke warm water along with the dried active yeast and stir well until it dissolves. 
            Leave for 10-15 minutes allowing the yeast to bubble.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the salt and flour, oil and yeast liquid and bring together until you have a smooth ball.</li>
        <li>If the dough is too dry add a little water 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together. Adjust with more flour if it is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Then turn out into a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes so the dough springs back slightly when you poke it.</li>
        <li>If you are using a stand mixer, knead the dough for approximately 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the kneaded dough ball into a large bowl and cover with cling film or a damp cloth. 
            Leave to rise for at least 2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To make the Manakish</h3>
    <ol> <!--Ordered list 3 // An order list for the steps involved in the recipe 'method'-->
        <li>Preheat the oven on your highest setting and make sure it is well heated before putting in the manakish.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 8 manakish balls, dust lightly with flour and cover with a teacloth.</li>
        <li>Roll out a dough ball between 3-5mm thick, dusting with extra flour to avoid sticking.</li>
        <li>Brush on a little vegetable or mild olive oil, and add a fair amount of cheese spreading it with your hands and leaving a small margin.</li>
        <li>Lightly dimple the surface with three outstretched fingers a few times.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese bubbles and the manakish start to brown on the outside, turning if necessary to get an even bake.</li>
    </ol>
