    <h2 class="box">IGN - 9/10</h2>
    <p>"Honkai: Star Rail is the best free-to-play game of the year so far. Its stellar storytelling and satisfying progression systems offer 
        dozens of hours of content that a HoYo newcomer can enjoy, even without paying for gacha items or having played Honkai Impact 3rd or 
        Genshin Impact. Combat boasts layers of strategy for those willing to dig into details without barring more casual players from enjoying it. 
        Its worldbuilding also expands outside of the main story into the side missions and interactable objects, making an already captivating world 
        even more lively. It surpasses even Genshin in my mind, and I can see myself playing even months from now." -Jess Reyes</p>
    <h2 class="box">PCMag - 4/5</h2>
    <p>"Itâ€™s rare to encounter a turn-based RPG that feels as stylish and engrossing as an action game, but Honkai: Star Rail pulls it off with aplomb. 
        It plays like RPGs from yesteryear (such as Final Fantasy X-2 and Super Mario RPG), yet the sci-fi setting, Persona-esque stylishness, and 
        excellent presentation make it feel thoroughly distinct. If you can avoid the gacha minefield and show some restraint with spending, you'll have 
        a great time. And it will only get better, as new episodes are added to expand the story. As such, Honkai: Star Rail is easy to recommend and 
        worthy of our Editors' Choice award." -Gabriel Zamora</p>
